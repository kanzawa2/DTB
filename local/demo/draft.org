******* Lecture material modification
        1) index.org
           Add ":" to %P description.
******* Q&A
        Q1) I am implimenting %D(delete) command.
            In %D command, it is necessary to initialize
            deleted structure after entry is deleted.
        A1) Initializing is not necessary.
            But you have to free memory that is allocated by malloc.
            And you should survey why you have to do it.
******* Reflection and impressions
        1) I did not distribute sheets to students.
           This reason is I thought that sheet is not necessary when oral examination is held.
           Thereafter, when I face to a different case, I will check with the teacher.
